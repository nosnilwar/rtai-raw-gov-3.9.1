Many files of this tool were delete, because they weren't necessary to this
application, only the gcc part is important.

Note: if the following error is happened "exec: arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc: not
found", open the arm-linux-gcc file and replace the executable line for:

	exec ./arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc -march=armv4t $*
	
Another thing that was changed was the path of line below. For it be used in the
"main" directory of this tool, that line should be:

exec ./tools/arm-linux-gcc-4.3.2/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc -march=armv4t $*
